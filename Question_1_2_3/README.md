# Question 1:  Duplicate Finder

## Description

This project provides a generic class that finds duplicate elements present in a given list and prints them. It includes a class called `Question_1` that uses a `HashMap` to efficiently find and list duplicate items from a provided list.

## Usage

### Question_1 Class

The `Question_1` class has the following methods:

- `public List<String> findDuplicates()`: Method that finds and returns a list of duplicate items present in the input list.

### Question_1Test Class

The `Question_1Test` class contains unit tests for the `Question_1` class. It uses the JUnit framework to verify the correctness of the `findDuplicates()` method.

## How to Run

1. Download the project to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Run the `Question_1` class to see the demonstration of finding duplicate items from a predefined list.
4. Run the `Question_1Test` class to execute the unit tests and verify the correctness of the code.

## Dependencies

- Java 8 or higher
- JUnit 5 (for running the tests)

# Question 2: Color Sorter

This program demonstrates sorting a list of colors in a specific order. The program is designed to efficiently sort objects implementing the `IColorable` interface based on their color properties: "red", "white", and "blue".

## Usage

## Question_2 Class
The `Question_2` class has the following methods:

- `public static void sortColors(List<IColorable> colorables)`: Method that finds and returns a list of duplicate items present in the input list.

## Question_2Test Class
The `Question_2Test` class contains unit tests for the Question_3 class. It uses the JUnit framework to verify the correctness of the sorting.

## How to Run

1. Download the project to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Run the `Question_2` class to see the demonstration the sorting of colors in a specific order.
4. Run the `Question_2Test` class to execute the unit tests and verify the correctness of the code.

## Dependencies

- Java 8 or higher
- JUnit 5 (for running the tests)

# Question 3: Generic Pop Implementation of a Stack

## Description

This provides a generic stack implementation, where you can push and pop elements of any given data type. It includes a class called `Question_3` that represents a stack data structure.

## Usage

### Question_3 Class

The `Question_3` class has the following methods:

- `public Question_3()`: Constructor that initializes an empty stack.
- `public void push(T item)`: Method to push an element onto the stack.
- `public T pop()`: Method to pop and return the top element from the stack.
- `public boolean isEmpty()`: Method to check if the stack is empty.

### Question_3Test Class

The `Question_3Test` class contains unit tests for the `Question_3` class. It uses the JUnit framework to verify the correctness of the stack implementation methods.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Run the `Question_3` class to see the demonstration of pushing and popping elements from the stack.
4. Run the `Question_3Test` class to execute the unit tests and verify the correctness of the stack implementation.
